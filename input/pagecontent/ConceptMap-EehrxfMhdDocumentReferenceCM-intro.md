This ConceptMap is intended to guide implementers in understanding how the coarse-grained priority categories defined in the EHDS regulation relate to specific document types identified by LOINC codes, and it may evolve over time as clinical practice changes and new document types become relevant for cross-border exchange.

This ValueSet groups the priority category specific ValueSets:
- `Patient-Summaries` codes are found in [EEHRxFDocumentTypePatientSummaryVS](ValueSet-EEHRxFDocumentTypePatientSummaryVS.html)
- `Discharge-Reports` codes are found in [EEHRxFDocumentTypeDischargeReportVS](ValueSet-EEHRxFDocumentTypeDischargeReportVS.html)
- `Laboratory-Reports` codes are found in [EEHRxFDocumentTypeLaboratoryReportVS](ValueSet-EEHRxFDocumentTypeLaboratoryReportVS.html)
- `Medical-Imaging` codes are found in [EEHRxFDocumentTypeMedicalImagingVS](ValueSet-EEHRxFDocumentTypeMedicalImagingVS.html)

No Document Types are assigned to #Electronic-Prescriptions or #Electronic-Dispensations; as these are not considered appropriate use-cases for Documents.

**This Concept Map is Informative.** The codes mapped here are the known document type codes for the indicated priority category. This ConceptMap is expected to evolve over time as clinical practice changes and new document types become relevant for cross-border exchange.
