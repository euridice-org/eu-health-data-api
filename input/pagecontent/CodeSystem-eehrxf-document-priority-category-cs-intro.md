The codes defined here are directly linked to the Priority Categories defined in the EHDS regulation. The meaning of these codes is directly linked to the meaning given to the concepts in the EHDS regulation. This direct linkage to the regulated meaning ensures that they are by definition perfectly aligned with the regulatory text. This in contract to finding LOINC codes that seem relevant. LOINC codes are used for the document type, so there is a need to map between the priority category code defined here, and the LOINC codes for the document types.

The EHDS Regulation initially defines six priority categories of electronic health data that all Member States must support first for cross-border primary use. These categories are explicitly listed in [Article 14](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/327/oj#d1e2289-1-1) of Regulation (EU) 2025/327.

[Article 105](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/327/oj#d1e6862-1-1) specifies the date when support for these priority categories is required: 26 March 2029 for categories (a), (b) and (c); 28 March 2031 for (d), (e) and (f).

EHDS empowers the EU Commission to make changes to the list of priority categories at any point in time by means of a Delegated Act (Article 14(2)). There will be a minimum 1-year lead time between the decision to add a new priority category and the initial date when support ahs to be implemented.

The definitions of the priority categories comes from [ANNEX I](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32025R0327#annex-I) of the EHDS Regulation.

**This Code System is Informative.** The codes defined here are not intended to be used as-is in implementations, but rather to provide a clear link between the technical specifications in this Implementation Guide and the concepts defined in the EHDS regulation. Implementers should refer to the content profiles for each priority category for the specific data elements and structures that need to be supported for each category.
